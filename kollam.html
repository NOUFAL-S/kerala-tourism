                Ashtamudi Lake, in the Kollam District of the Indian state of
                Kerala, is the most visited backwater and lake in the state. It
                possesses a unique wetland ecosystem and a large palm-shaped
                water body, second only in size to the Vembanad estuary
                ecosystem of the state. Ashtamudi means 'eight braids' in the
                local Malayalam language. The name is indicative of the lake's
                topography with its multiple branches. The lake is also called
                the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is well known for
                its houseboat and backwater resorts.
